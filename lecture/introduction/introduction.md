# Introduction

In the first block of this course we will focus on the the necessary tools for scientific computing and how to aquire them. So we will go on a quick side-quest that is still very important for programming and computational work in general. After that we will have multiple content sessions were we will explore the concept of digital literacy, what that means for us and the scientific community and we will finally get aquainted with the tools that we actually will want to use to make our lifes as scientists easier. 

## Schedule

Please see below for our current optimistic schedule. Depending on our progress, potential problems and different forms of learning, content and times might change a bit. Each lecture will be divided into several parts separated by a 5-10 minute break and might constitute a transition from basic to advanced concepts, theoretic to practical sessions and individual to group work. The different parts are roughly indicated in the schedule below like this:

🗓 - important information on date & time  
💡 - input from the instructor  
👨🏻‍🏫 - instructor presents content  
🥼 - research project work  
🧑🏽‍💻🧑🏾‍💻 - work on demo data  
🧑🏿‍🔬👩🏻‍🔬 - work on own research project  
🖥️ - computational work outside course hours  
✍🏽 - writing outside course hours  
📖 - reading outside course hours
